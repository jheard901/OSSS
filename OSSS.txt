Operating System Snapshot
aka: OSSS, OS3, OS cubed

This software is open source and is designed to work with any OS for the
purpose of taking a snapshot of the user interface, then restoring that
snapshot at anytime the user wants it.

The idea of it is to remember all opened files, folders, and applications
that are shown on the gui (taskbar in windows), and be able to reopen these
whenever the system restarts or if we just want to open up a different
type of interface later. Configurable settings should include whether or not
to save files, folders, or application; additionally, it could blacklist some
filepaths in case users never want a particular file to never get saved in a
snapshot, or even whitelist in case they want open specific files to get saved
in a snapshot.

It should read the path to the opened file, and copy that. For reopening it,
it should check first to make sure the file isn't already opened. It should
query the harddrive to make sure it is not asleep before attempting to open it
- I think, don't really see this as a requirement though. It should acknowledge
any applications that have dependencies on other applications such as a console
window that is opened by a parent process/window like in Amazon's Lumberyard
game engine at startup it has the asset browser dependent on the main process.
